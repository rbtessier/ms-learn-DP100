# ms-learn-DP100
 my notes for microsoft learn DP100 course

My general approach is this - use jupyter lab to write down exactly what the microsoft learn online courses says - after reading it. When it comes to code, I type the code in myself if I read it and don't understand it, then try to understand it again afterwards. I then do the labs. I then assess whether I need to do an assignment. I suggest keeping the SDK reference open in a window to review when there's Methods you don't understand.

July 30 progress plan
1. do MOD4 lab
2. Decide whether to do next MOD by skimming MOD5, or to read and implement documentation model training tutorial (then follow up with restructuring my bike-sharing code to fit with this example.)

Make sure to point out that the Azure ML SDK for Python has 
- Tutorials, 
- sample notebooks, 
- REST API reference, 
- CLI reference and general reference
