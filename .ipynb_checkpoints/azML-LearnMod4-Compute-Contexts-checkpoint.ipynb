This had me worried that I was getting bad numbers due to this. After testing on the Notebook on my ML workspace in Azure, that didn't seem to be the problem, but it highlights how running on a certain environment and having consistent packages is important!!\n",

Local did not work because I was trying to run it from my desktop. from the error docs it appears to be because I didn't have Docker + other dependencies. The reason I tried local first is that I copied the code I used to run my model with a script in my `myCIWorkstationRyan` notebook. since the compute target was `local` when I ran on my home computer it tried to run in the same way on the machine where the code was stored. Since I changed to my own computer it didn't work. \n",

    "In Azure Machine Learning, Compute Targets are physical or virtual computers on which experiments are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to assign experiment runs to specific compute targets helps you implement a flexible data science ecosystem in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code can be developed and tested on local or low-cost compute, and then moved to more scalable compute for production workloads.\n",
    "- You can run individual processes on the compute target that best fits its needs. For example, by using GPU-based compute to train deep learning models, and switching to lower-cost CPU-only compute to test and register the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core benefits of cloud computing is the ability to manage costs by paying only for what you use. In Azure Machine Learning, you can take advantage of this principle by defining compute targets that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start on-demand and stop automatically when no longer required.\n",
    "- Scale automatically based on workload processing needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Compute\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning supports multiple types of compute for experimentation and training, and for production inferencing. This enables you to select the most appropriate type of compute target for your particular needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local compute\n",
    "You can specify a local compute target for most processing tasks in Azure Machine Learning. This runs the experiment on the same compute target as the code used to initiate the experiment, which may be your physical workstation or a virtual machine such as an Azure Machine Learning compute instance on which you are running a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local compute is generally a great choice during development and testing with low to moderate volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compute clusters\n",
    "For experiment workloads with high scalability requirements, you can use Azure Machine Learning compute clusters; which are multi-node clusters of Virtual Machines that automatically scale up or down to meet demand. This is a cost-effective way to run experiments that need to handle large volumes of data or use parallel processing to distribute the workload and reduce the time it takes to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference clusters\n",
    "To deploy trained models as production services, you can use Azure Machine Learning inference clusters, which use containerization technologies to enable rapid initialization of compute for on-demand inferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attached compute\n",
    "If you already use an Azure-based compute environment for data science, such as a virtual machine or an Azure Databricks cluster, you can attach it to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and use it as a compute target for certain types of workload.\n",
