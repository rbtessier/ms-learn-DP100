# ms-learn-DP100
 my notes for microsoft learn DP100 course

My general approach is this - use jupyter lab to write down exactly what the microsoft learn online courses says - after reading it. When it comes to code, I type the code in myself if I read it and don't understand it, then try to understand it again afterwards. I then do the labs. I then assess whether I need to do an assignment. I suggest keeping the SDK reference open in a window to review when there's Methods you don't understand. Its also useful to get comfortable 

# Tips for navigating

The `azML-`... files are notes for the MS Learn online module content. I include my own thoughts on the lecture. Suggest keeping SDK reference open to look up classes & their attributes and methods. Defer to progress

# July 30 progress plan
1. (DONE) do MOD4 lab
2. Decide whether to do next MOD by skimming MOD5, or to read and implement documentation model training tutorial (then follow up with restructuring my bike-sharing code to fit with this example.)
3. Install docker on desktop and run Experiment on `local` compute target Docker installation.

# Notes on Teaching

On the azML- notes I'm making I include my own comments about how the lesson is going, with the intention of referring to this all when I need to build training.

Make sure to point out that the Azure ML SDK for Python has 
- Tutorials, 
- sample notebooks, 
- REST API reference, 
- CLI reference and general reference

# Notes on Studying
For DP-100 test
- they often straightup ask about methods, so I need to get familiar with common ones and read a lot of code. For instance in LP2 MOD4 Compute Contexts they straight up asked about which `Environment` class should be

Fun things to learn:
- How to set default compute_target
