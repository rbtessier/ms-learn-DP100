    "In Azure Machine Learning, data scientsts can run *experiments* based on scripts that process data, train machine learning models, adn perform other data science tasks. The runtime context for each experiment run consists of two elements:\n",
    "- The *environment* for the scirpt, which includes all packages on which the script depends.\n",

    "# Ryan's Thoughts\n",
    "In my `kaggle_bike-sharing-demand-asmlMOD1-Copy1` I read a number of warnings about my sklearn not being the same version as that used in the model training (on workspace). This had me worried that I was getting bad numbers due to this. After testing on the Notebook on my ML workspace in Azure, that didn't seem to be the problem, but it highlights how running on a certain environment and having consistent packages is important!!"

    "In an enterprise machine learning solution, where experiments may be run in a variety of compute contexts, it can be important to be aware of the environments in which your experiment code is running. Environments are encapsulated by the Environment class; which you can use to create environments and specify runtime configuration for an experiment.\n",

Alternatively, you can manage your own environments and register them.
