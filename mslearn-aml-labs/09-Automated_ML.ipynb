    "# Using Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of machine learning algorithm that you can use to train a model, and sometimes it's not easy to determine the most effective algorithm for your particular data and prediction requirements. Additionally, you can significantly affect the predictive performance of a model by preprocessing the training data, using techniques such as normalization, missing feature imputation, and others. In your quest to find the *best* model for your requirements, you may need to try many combinations of algorithms and preprocessing transformations; which takes a lot of time and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning enables you to automate the comparison of models trained using different algorithms and preprocessing options. You can use the visual interface in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml/azure.com) or the SDK to leverage this capability. he SDK gives you greater control over the settings for the automated machine learning experiment, but the visual interface is easier to use. In this lab, you'll explore automated machine learning using the SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed the *Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace* and *Create a Compute Instance* tasks in [Lab 1: Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](./labdocs/Lab01.md). Then open this notebook in Jupyter on your Compute Instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connect to Your Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is to connect to your workspace using the Azure ML SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you do not have a current authenticated session with your Azure subscription, you'll be prompted to authenticate. Follow the instructions to authenticate using the code provided."
